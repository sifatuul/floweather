## 🌍 API

This project uses the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/) to fetch real-time weather information. Currently, the project uses a **public demo key**, but for long-term usage, it's recommended to [sign up](https://openweathermap.org/) and get your own free API key.

## ⚠️ Limitations

- **Public API Key**: This project uses a free public API key, which has limited requests. It’s highly recommended that you use your own API key from OpenWeatherMap to avoid rate limiting.

## ✨ Future Enhancements

- Add a 5-day weather forecast feature.
- Show weather information based on the user’s current geolocation.
- Allow users to toggle between Celsius and Fahrenheit.
